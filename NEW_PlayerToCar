//If you're feeling extra motivated it's be a good idea to make the gamemode support this new improved function, although by no means will it have some sort of signifcant perforamnce gains, not like PlayerToCar is called every frame.
//If you're feel like re-writing even more stuff, do a simliar this to 'stock NearestAccessCar()'
